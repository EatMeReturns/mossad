Labyrinth is an experiment on making a game that learns and procedurally generates a meaningful story. A general sense of exploration should be coupled and contrasted with a pervading sense of fear. Do not mistake this fear as an element of the game: it should be generated within the player explicitly through game mechanics. The game itself is expressionless, faceless: a creature of darkness. Thus, no character has a face or voice. The only sounds are those of the physical realm. The smack of metal on flesh, the click of a flashlight, the grating of a sliding wall. The environment is alive. It moves, it wills. There is a clear conflict between the player and the environment. It is not player versus enemies in a house. It is player versus enemies versus house. The gameplay is that of survival: how long can you last in the house before succumbing to mortality? The player must maintain body and mind. Body is not a numeric measurement of health but is closer to reality in that limbs and organs become injured and crippled. The mind is a measure of sanity that impresses an emotion of fear on to the emotionless environment, turning the unbiased judge of darkness in to a more sinister shadow as the player approaches defeat. The spirit is driven purely by the player's constructed fear and makes no formal appearance in-game other than to punish stagnancy. Generally speaking, the player rarely observes the formation of the house. Where he looks, it already is there; he must discover for himself the generative and changing properties of his environment. This does not mean he will not witness change: these glimpses provide moments of tension to build on the fear of the player. This is descriptive of most fear-building exercises practiced in this game: slow, deliberate exploration broken by moments of rapid tension and high stress for the player. Most encounters carry the risk of death and defeat for the player. The player will understand and respect his own fragility in the house. The fear is thus two-fold: The sudden jump-scare terror of the high tension moments coupled with the slow building and realization of the player's morality demanding an observational caution. The house will employ traps. Walls that snap together, crushing limbs; floors that give way in to darkness; cramped dead ends.
