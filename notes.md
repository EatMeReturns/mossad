Labyrinth
===

Overview
---

**Labyrinth** is an experiment on making a game that learns and procedurally generates a meaningful story. A general sense of exploration should be coupled and contrasted with a pervading sense of fear. Do not mistake this fear as an element of the game: it should be generated within the player explicitly through game mechanics. The game itself is expressionless, faceless: a creature of darkness. Thus, no character has a face or voice. The only sounds are those of the physical realm. The smack of metal on flesh, the click of a flashlight, the grating of a sliding wall. The environment is alive. It moves, it wills. There is a clear conflict between the player and the environment. It is not player versus enemies in a house. It is player versus enemies versus house. The gameplay is that of survival: how long can you last in the house before succumbing to mortality? The player must maintain body and mind. Body is not a numeric measurement of health but is closer to reality in that limbs and organs become injured and crippled. The mind is a measure of sanity that impresses an emotion of fear on to the emotionless environment, turning the unbiased judge of darkness in to a more sinister shadow as the player approaches defeat. The spirit is driven purely by the player's constructed fear and makes no formal appearance in-game other than to punish stagnancy. Generally speaking, the player rarely observes the formation of the house. Where he looks, it already is there; he must discover for himself the generative and changing properties of his environment. This does not mean he will not witness change: these glimpses provide moments of tension to build on the fear of the player. This is descriptive of most fear-building exercises practiced in this game: slow, deliberate exploration broken by moments of rapid tension and high stress for the player. Most encounters carry the risk of death and defeat for the player. The player will understand and respect his own fragility in the house. The fear is thus two-fold: The sudden jump-scare terror of the high tension moments coupled with the slow building and realization of the player's mortality demanding an observational caution. The house will employ traps. Walls that snap together, crushing limbs; floors that give way in to darkness; cramped dead ends.

Enemies
---

**The Basilisk** is a boss with a grid for an arena. He surrounds the grid with his body, directing his head inward from the top-center. His attacks involve lunging strikes that always cripple and a stare that paralyzes the player over time. The player may do minor damage to his armored body all the way around the arena, but hitting the head will do the most damage. The player may also cripple the basilisk's eyes, negating his ability to paralyze. His movements produce a heavy hissing sound. (See: Harry Potter)

**The Emerald Widow** is a boss with a web for an arena. She surrounds the arena with thick webbings that cannot be penetrated. She hangs from a single ropy strand in the top middle or she drops to the arena floor. She attacks by producing splats of slowing web and by attempting to stab or bite the player with her legs and fangs. Her fangs contain a venom that does damage over time and that greatly reduces the player's sanity. Her movements produce a loud rustling and her spinneret sounds like a shrieking violin.

**My Shadow's Reflection** is a boss with no arena. Instead, it endlessly chases the player around. It is extremely difficult to hit, often fading in to the darkness to avoid attacks. It attacks with quick, short jabbing leaps that buffet the player away. They do little damage, as if they were hits from a small child, but they can occur in rapid succession. A constant chattering and multitudinous laughter are produced by this boss. It spawns when the player accumulates enough Ruby Moth followers. (See: Majora's Mask)

A **Shade** is a small creature characterized more as an absence of light than as a physical being. As a Minor, it looks like a wisp of inky smoke culminating in a large, bald, skeletal head atop two arms and shoulders rippling with muscle and sinew. It crawls quickly after prey, leaping and gnashing at anything in reach. The Major Shades are four to five times larger and possess a torso and legs, looking simian in form and movement. While both forms are fast, the Minors are weak and multitudinous while the Majors are almost always alone with their Minor spawn. Their movements produce a crackling sound. (See: Bullymog-Borderlands 2, Shadowling-Diablo 3)

A **Gloomrat** is a large, festering creature that cripples with the bacteria in its bite. It scurries around, generally running from conflict but becoming viciously aggressive when protecting young or when cornered. A pattering of its feet on the floor is the only sound this creature makes. (See: It's just a big fucking rat)

**The Avian** is a boss with an arena riddled with deep pits. The arena is surrounded by wide, uncrossable chasms. He is a humanoid with large, black wings that beat gusts of air at the player. He also slashes with large, hook-clawed hands and summons flocks of Ink Ravens. His wings may be crippled to slow his movements. His sounds are the flutter and whoosh of wings and loud, shrieking caws.

An **Ink Raven** is a black, fast bird that swoops out from the shadows like some fucking bat or some shit.

A **Spiderling** is a little spider that likes to swarm.

A **Ruby Moth** is a small flying insect that glows red, providing some light. It deals no damage and will follow around the player as a light source. It can be accidentally killed.

Items
---

The **Behold of the Eye** is a passive item that causes items and other loot to glow, both producing light and making them visible through walls.

The **Solar Flare** is an active item that expands a ring of light out from the player, briefly illuminating the entire nearby area.

**Glowsticks** are collectible single-use items that produce light for a brief-moderate amount of time. They can be held, dropped, or thrown.

**Fishing Line** is a collectible single-use item that leaves a trail of line to save sections of the house for an extended period of time, preventing rooms from despawning when they are out of sight.

The **Blinkstone** is an active item that instantly teleports the player a short distance. The player may only blink over walls if there is light at the target destination.

The **Scaled Shield** is a weapon that can be used to block attacks and bash enemies, briefly stunning them. When not in use, it passively blocks attacks to the player's back.

The **Spinneret** is a utility item that works like fishing line except that it lasts longer and it slows enemies.

The **Inktalons** are a weapon that causes the player's melee attacks to rend enemies, resulting in high damage and increased chance to cripple.

**Ammo** is a collectible single-use item that allows guns and other projectile weapons to be used. Special ammos may be found for specific weapons such as Silver Bolts for the crossbow.

The **Pistol**, **Shotgun**, **Crossbow**, **Flare Gun**, and **Assault Rifle** are all weapons that can expend Ammo. Their special ammo types are Fragmenting Bullets, Solid Slugs, Silver Bolts, Napalm Flares, and FMJ Rounds.

The **Eversack** is a passive item that allows the player to carry an unlimited amount of items and equipment. Furthermore, carry weight no longer incurs a movespeed penalty.

Combat Rules
---

- Taking damage occurs per-body section; the direction the player faces and the direction of the damage source determines whether it is a hit to the Head, L/R Arm, Torso, or L/R Leg.
-If a body section is hit hard enough, often enough, or enough times in a short period of time, it will become crippled.
- A crippled body part will debuff the player; one arm slows melee attacks and makes projectiles less accurate, two arms disables the player's ability to attack, one leg slows the player, two legs almost immobilizes the player, the head reduces the player's vision, and the torso reduces carry capacity and turn rate.
- If a crippled body section is hit hard enough, often enough, or enough times in a short period of time, it will become mortally wounded.
- A mortal wound will give the player a short amount of time to apply first aid before killing the player.

#### Revised prototype/simpler/better combat rules:

- Taking damage is no longer per-body.
- Being hit hard enough, often enough, or enough times in a short period of time will cripple a random body part, applying a random debuff and desiring first aid.
- Being hit hard enough, often enough, or enough times while the player has at least one crippled body part will result in a mortal wound, requiring first aid.

Some Paragraphs Regarding Combat
---

- The combat mechanics must define a system for creative player interaction. It is easy to fall in to a trap of discrete successful and unsuccessful play. Either the limitations of engagement are too involved or the methods for engagement are too few. Thus, attacks must at least provide the illusion of player direction. Fighting games have mastered this sense of control; in Super Smash Bros., there are multiple types of attacks all easily directioned and timed to produce differing results. The player may employ the ttack strategically. The simplest of physics engines can serve as the playground for player direction to develop.
- It is not difficult to make a roguelike feel like a grind. The combat in labyrinth will produce high-tension moments for the player that are regularly matters of life and death-that is, of the threat of defeat and loss. Combat is an investiture for the player of emotion, effort, and in-game resources. It should be a challenge resulting in a pervading sense of success rather than the dull acknowledgement of accrued resources that produces the grinding mechanic. This does not mean the player is not grinding. the player simply does not feel like he is grinding.
- To stamp out combat: The player must feel control over his actions in-game. The player must commit the violence of creativity on our canvas that we define with functionality and limitations. The functionality must be complex enough to provide depth to attacks. The limitations must be simple. A basic interaction of physics-forces affecting the positions of entities-adds incredible depth if it can be achieved. The combat must be challenging. It must require active participation of the player's emotions and thought processes. It must not feel like a grind for resources, even if that is what it is. It is a balanced system of mechanics.
